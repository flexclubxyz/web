## Introduction

Flexclub is designed to revolutionize the way people save money by making the process more engaging and rewarding. Our platform allows users to set specific financial goals and work towards achieving them collectively, while earning higher interest rates compared to traditional savings accounts.

## Problem Flexclub Solves

Flexclub addresses several key problems faced by traditional financial systems:

### Lack of Incentive to Save

Traditional savings methods often lack engaging structures, leading to low motivation for consistent savings. Flexclub introduces a goal-based saving mechanism, making the process more engaging and rewarding.

### Low Interest Rates

Savings accounts in traditional banking systems generally offer low interest rates, which do not significantly grow savings over time. Flexclub leverages DeFi platforms like Aave to earn higher interest on pooled funds, providing better returns for members.

### Financial Exclusion

Many people around the world lack access to basic financial services, including savings accounts. Flexclub operates on the blockchain, offering a decentralized and accessible platform where anyone with an internet connection can participate, thus promoting financial inclusion.

### Lack of Transparency and Control

Traditional financial systems often operate with a lack of transparency and give limited control to account holders. Flexclub, built on blockchain technology, ensures transparency in all transactions and gives users full control over their funds, held in self-custodial accounts.

## How It Works

1. **Create or Join a Flexclub**: Users can create a new Flexclub or join an existing one. Each club has a specific financial goal and its own smart contract.
2. **Deposit USDC**: Members deposit USDC into the club's smart contract on the Base network.
3. **Earn Interest**: The pooled funds are invested in DeFi platforms like Aave to earn interest.
4. **Achieve Goals**: Members collectively work towards achieving the club's financial goal.
5. **Withdraw Funds**: Members can withdraw their share of the pooled funds plus the earned interest at any time.
